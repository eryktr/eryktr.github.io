# About me
My name is Eryk. I'm a software engineer and soluutions architect, currently living in Poland.
Software engineering has always been my biggest passion, but not the only one.

Apart from building software systems, as a huge fan of studying foreign languages, 
I'm currently working to master up my German and to get fluent in Spanish.

Some time ago I got in the habit of pursuing fitness and I've reached a point of no return.
Therefore, you are likely to meet me in a gym or, when the weather permits, in a street workout park.


# Purpose of the blog
According to the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/), the best way
to master something is to share the knowledge in simple terms.
I've been applying this method for a couple of months, yet recently I've reached a conclusion
- it costs me nothing to put together a concise blog post and others can benefit from that
or even kindle a motivating discussion.

Most likely post topics:

* Latest programming languages, frameworks and features
* Foreign languages (maybe a series of Polish or German posts)
* Topics directly connected with software engineering (Math, algorithms, data structures)
